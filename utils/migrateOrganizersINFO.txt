	•	Logging Levels:
	•	You can adjust the logging level by changing the level property in the Winston logger configuration.
	•	For production, you might want to log at info or warn level to reduce verbosity.
	•	Error Handling:
	•	The script includes try-catch blocks around critical operations.
	•	Errors are logged with detailed messages, including the error message and context.
	•	Resetting ImportBTCOrganizers:
	•	The script modifies the .env file to set ImportBTCOrganizers=false after running.
	•	Ensure that this behavior is acceptable in your environment.
	•	Alternatively, you could manage this variable through environment variables in your CI/CD pipeline without modifying the .env file.

      Notes:

	•	Environment Variables:
	•	Store MONGODB_URI in GitHub Secrets for security.
	•	You can control ImportBTCOrganizers via the workflow file or by setting it in GitHub Secrets if you prefer.
	•	Dependencies:
	•	Ensure all dependencies (axios, mongoose, dotenv, winston) are listed in your package.json and installed.
	•	Error Handling in CI/CD:
	•	If the migration script fails, you may want the build to fail as well.
	•	Adjust the script to exit with a non-zero exit code on failure if necessary.

Final Checklist

	•	Ensure that the default region “Northeast”, division “New England”, and city “Boston” exist in your database.
	•	Verify that models in ../models are correctly defined and exported.
	•	Confirm that the .env file is properly configured and accessible.
	•	Test the script in a non-production environment before deploying to production.
	•	Review logging outputs to ensure that they meet your requirements.

Summary

The updated script now aligns with your specified requirements:

	•	Uses Winston for robust logging.
	•	Leverages models from ../models.
	•	Defaults regions, divisions, and cities by fetching their _ids from the database.
	•	Exclusively uses the REST API for data fetching.
	•	Includes comprehensive error handling and logging for easy troubleshooting.
	•	Resets the ImportBTCOrganizers environment variable after execution.
